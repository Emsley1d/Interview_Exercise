# Interview Exercise
#

## Objective

The goal of this exercise is to provide a showcase of your software design capabilities, your software
development skills and your knowledge of best practices.

For this reason, this exercise tries to cover several different aspects of a typical software solution.
This is not a production exercise and it will never be used in a real environment; it is not expected to
use real data. The purpose of this exercise is merely academic, to show your knowledge and
technical skills in different aspects of what would be representative of your potential future role as a
Software Developer within the team.

#

## Description
The task is to develop an application where end users can enter and track Timesheets for given
employees.

For reference, the technologies used within our team that could be used for this exercise are:

• Windows Forms (C#, VB.NET)
• Web Based Applications (PHP, ASP.NET)
• Mobile Applications (Xamarin, PowerApps)
• Office Based Applications (Excel, Word)

For the purposes of this exercise, we encourage you to use these, but we would consider
applicants using a different approaches if the solution provided is well designed and/or is
creative enough.

## Business Case

WEF would like you to manage their timesheets electronically for their employees.

Currently, they submit their timesheets via paper which is then stored in Folders within their office.
They have grown to a size where they can no longer manage this.

WEF have no strong feelings around which technology they would like to use, they are
simply looking to digitise this process to minimise errors and speed up entry.

The timesheet application needs to be able to select a Job, an Employee and the time taken on that
job in each day, once data has been entered, they would like to be able to review timesheets
entered via a Timesheet Summary Report.

They have also added, if possible, to be able to automatically calculate time remaining on each job
based on what timesheets have been entered up to now and if any Employee works over 10 hours in
a day, an email should be automatically sent to management.
